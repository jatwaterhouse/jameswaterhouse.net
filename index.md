## Playing chess
_Posted on August 02, 2019_

I was reminded last week during a 1-2-1 with one of my staff members that the transition from an operational role into a management/leadership position can be tricky for a number of reasons.  One of the hardest things to get to grips with is the changing face of what success looks like and the sources from which we as individuals can get a sense of accomplishment.

Those with a traditional BI or data science background are used to picking up a problem, owning it through the analytical process and producing some tangible output which is then acted upon.  With the transition to a role of leadership, the successes aren't at first so obvious.  

The sense of accomplishment that used to stem from 'producing and distributing a new dashboard' or 'releasing a new predictive model' now has to come from 'the moment when the analtyics team and the data engineering team collectively realise that prioritising making improvements to a visualisation tool will make both all their lives easier' or 'the moment a prevously distant team elsewhere comes to your team for help with a complex problem'.  

A sense of achievement and accomplishment needs to come from the small improvement and steps forward that are taken every day.  It's a long game but the reward at the end is much bogger.  As I reminded my colleague last week, _"We're playing chess now, not carving the pieces"_.

## Be nice
_Posted on May 11, 2019_

This week I had the pleasure of attending the inaugural "Data Science Engagement and Employability Conference" hosted by the [Leeds Data Science Society](https://www.leedsdatascience.com/).  The event included some interesting presentations from current students and researchers at the University of Leeds, along with lightening talks by companies who make use of data science including SB&G.

Following the event it was great to catch up with [Lawrence Ning](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ningdata/) who is a co-founder of the society.  Lawrence recalled the first time we met, which was nearly 4 years ago now.  At a time when they where struggling for traction to get the society off the ground and finding it difficult to make connections in industry, we invited them in to our office at SB&G for a coffee and a chat.  In all honesty I'd since forgotten this first meeting, however Lawrence recalled it with great fondness, suggested it was one of a number of early engagements that made him believe the Society could be a success.

4 years later and the Society is going from strength to strength, with an ever growing presence in Leeds and beyond.

I'm by no means overplaying the significance of our initial meeting; the Society has it's own success story.  It did however make me realise the importance of being nice; of giving people the time of day, of listening and encouraging others whereever possible.  Many of us are too wrapped up in our own lives, our own problems and challenges, our own to-do-lists to ever spare any time for others which is really sad.

Next time someone asks you for a catch up, for a quick chat or to go for coffee, try make the time and go along with an open mind.  You never know what exciting ideas they might have!

## Arts vital for science to flourish
_Posted on April 22, 2019_

People often ask what skills and qualities make the perfect data scientist.  The most obvious answers are statistical knowledge, coding ability and data wrangling expertise.  

Less obvious but just as important are domain knowledge, common sense and pragmatism.  Knowing what will work within the context of your business and having the acumen to make it happen count just as much as technical expertise if your aim is to deliver material value from your work.

But that's not it.  One of the most important qualities often much more difficult to find in an individual is CREATIVITY.  Years of educational policy have put increased emphasis on core academic subjects at the expense of fully developing creative skills and the ability for people to think outside the box.

Data science is an art.  Business opportunities and/or problems are the canvas; data is the paint.  However without creativity and the ability to join it all up, at best you'll get paint-by-numbers, at worst you'll get nothing at all.  You'll certainly never innovate.

Creative subjects are just as important as the academic ones and we should support their continued teaching in our schools and universities.

## A mountain to climb
_Posted on March 19, 2019_

Last year I was fortunate enough to spend some time on a residential team building/leadership development 'camp' in the Lake District, run by John Peck and his colleagues from [Tiger Teams](http://www.tigerteams.co.uk/).

John, a retired Met Police Chief Superintendent, has dedicated his life to adventure having climbed mountains in the Himalayas, rowed across the Atlantic Ocean and completed the Marathon des Sables amongst other feats.  I found him to be an absorbing and inspirational character with a real aura.

The few days spent away from the world in the company of both gambling industry peers but also recovering gambling addicts had a profound effect on me and I returned home with a list of things to change and things I was determined to do.

One such thing on my list was to read John's biography 'Restless' which documents some of his biggest adventures.

I was really taken aback by a quote which opens the book from [Walter Bonatti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bonatti):

> The mountains are the means; the man is the end.  The idea is to improve the man, not to reach the top of the mountains.

I've found over the years that working in data and analytics across multiple projects can seem neverending.  

Our teams often are classed as 'central services' and with that comes the constant battle of prioritisation, the slog of incidents and bug fixes and the iterative steps of improvement.

Our work is never really finished; we never get to the top of the mountain.  But Walter Bonatti's quote reminded me that it's not really about that!
