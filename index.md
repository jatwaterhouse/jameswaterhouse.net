## A mountain to climb
_Posted on March 19, 2019_

Last year I was fortunate enough to spend some time on a residential team building/leadership development 'camp' in the Lake District, run by John Peck and his colleagues from [Tiger Teams](http://www.tigerteams.co.uk/).

John, a retired Met Police Chief Superintendent, has dedicated his life to adventure having climbed mountains in the Himalayas, rowed across the Atlantic Ocean and completed the Marathon des Sables amongst other feats.  I found him to be an absorbing and inspirational character with a real aura.

The few days spent away from the world in the company of both gambling industry peers but also recovering gambling addicts had a profound effect on me and I returned home with a list of things to change and things I was determined to do.

One such thing on my list was to read John's biography 'Restless' which documents some of his biggest adventures.

I was really taken aback by a quote which opens the book from [Walter Bonatti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bonatti):

> The mountains are the means; the man is the end.  The idea is to improve the man, not to reach the top of the mountains.

I've found over the years that working in data and analytics across multiple projects can seem neverending.  

Our teams often are classed as 'central services' and with that comes the constant battle of prioritisation, the slog of incidents and bug fixes and the iterative steps of improvement.

Our work is never really finished; we never get to the top of the mountain.  But Walter Bonatti's quote reminded me that it's not really about that!
