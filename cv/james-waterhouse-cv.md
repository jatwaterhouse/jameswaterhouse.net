# Profile
A passionate and motivated data strategist with experience spanning multiple analytical and management roles in both business insight and data science.

I combine technical ability with creativity and commercial awareness to create new opportunities from data.  

With over 8 years experience working within a rapidly growing tech business, I am comfortable communicating at a senior management level, whilst being able to also roll my sleaves up and understand the detail and effort it will take to get things done 'on the ground'.

My experience working both within and in support of commercial teams means I am able to balance pragmatism with foresight to deliver in both the short and long terms.

I strongly believe that data holds the key to business success and I am obsessed with unlocking its value.
