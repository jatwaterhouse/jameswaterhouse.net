# Profile
I am a passionate and motivated data strategist and leader, with experience spanning multiple analytical and management roles in both business insight and data science.

I combine technical ability with creativity and commercial awareness to create new opportunities from data.  

With over 8 years experience working within a rapidly growing tech business, I am comfortable operating at all levels from senior management down to engineers, analysts and execs working on day to day delivery.

I work on a daily basis with members of our senior management team, but am equally as happy rolling my sleaves up in order to get things done 'on the ground'.

My experience working both within and in support of commercial teams means I am able to balance pragmatism with foresight to deliver in both the short and long terms.

I strongly believe that data holds the key to business success and I am obsessed with unlocking its value.
